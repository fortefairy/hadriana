<h2>Nathalie Jolivert </h2>
<img src="/img/nathalie.jpg" alt="Nathalie Jolivert" /> </div> <div id="column-b">
<p> is a Haitian architect and artist based in New York City. She was first introduced to Ren√© Depestre‚Äôs novel ‚ÄúHadriana in All my Dreams‚Äù while doing research in Jacmel for her undergraduate degree project at the Rhode Island School of Design. Jolivert‚Äôs project focused on the architectural preservation of Le Manoir Alexandra, Hadriana‚Äôs prominent villa in the center of town. In her studies, Jolivert felt enthralled by the young French protagonist‚Äôs mystical story, which has haunted Jacmel for generations. In her research, she connected with various artists, literary scholars and architectural preservationists and quickly understood the important role this novel played in memorializing the essence of a city that prides itself as the cultural capital of Haiti. It is this process that resulted in ‚Ä¶.Nathalie Jolivert 
As a multi-media artist, Nathalie remains passionate about spatial narratives, cultural and architectural preservation, urbanism and environmental issues. Her exhibitions include ‚ÄòBonjour Tristesse‚Äô at Barney Savage Gallery in New York, 2018, ‚ÄòLavi Miy√≤‚Äô at FiveMyles Gallery in New York, 2018, ‚ÄòCuriosit√©s Urbaines‚Äô at La Lorraine in Port-au-Prince, 2016, and ‚ÄòFrontiers of Development‚Äô at the Ronald Reagan building and International Trade Center in Washington, DC, 2014</p>

<div class="row"><div id="column-a"> <h2>Tessa Mars</h2> <img src="/img/tessa.jpg" alt="Tessa Mars" /></div> <div id="column-b"><p> was born in 1985 in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, where she continues to live and work. She completed a bachelor in Visual Arts in France, at Rennes 2 University in 2006. Her artistic career truly begins in 2008 with her participation in the 5th Transcultural Forum of Contemporary art organized by the AfricAmericA Foundation in Port-au-Prince. Three years later she‚Äôs part of the collective exhibition Haiti Kingdom of This world (2011). This traveling exhibition presented initially at the Agn√®s b. gallery in Paris inaugurated the first Haitian pavilion at the Venice Biennale the same year. In 2015, the artist spent three months at the Alice Yard space in Trinidad and Tobago, as part of an artistic residency. It is during this stay that she creates the character of Tessalines, her alter ego, a female hybrid of Jean Jacques Dessalines, leader of the Haitian revolution. The work produced during this residency marks a turning point in her career and gives rise to an exhibition at the French Institute of Port-au-Prince, Tessalines and Moi, her first solo show. Linking past and present, Mars‚Äôs recent work offers alternate narratives on past and current traumas both personal and collective as a means of empowerment and healing. The work questions the processes through which we build ourselves as individuals and groups. Looking at identity through the lens of gender, history and culture, she questions notions of belonging, sacrifice, transformation and resistance. Mars‚Äôs work has been most recently shown during the 10th Berlin Biennale in 2018, and in 2019 with her Solo show √éle mod√®le-Manman zile-Island template in Port-au-Prince.

<div id="column-a"><h2>Mafalda Mondestin</h2><img src="/img/mafalda.jpg" alt="Mafalda Mondestin" /> </div>
<div id="column-b"><p> is a Haitian visual artist born in 1982 and raised in the United States, Haiti, and Canada. A precocious talent, she was enrolled in the Saint Soley youth workshops with Jean-Claude Garoute (commonly known as Ti Ga) in 1990. After completing an Associates Degree in Graphic Design at Valencia Community College in 2004, she moved to New York City in 2010 to fully devote herself to her calling in visual arts.  In 2012, Nicolas Mondestin relocated to Haiti where she has since worked with flagship arts organizations such as Fondation AfricAmeÃÅrica and Le Centre d‚ÄôArt. Nicolas Mondestin has exhibited in Haiti, the United States and France. Her art practice encompasses multiples mediums such as painting, drawing and printmaking. Nicolas Mondestin‚Äôs most recent body of work starts as an exploration of the relationship that exists between female bodies and the spaces they evolve in, most specifically nature. Bare female bodies are seen holding court in an idyllic landscape, that remains untouched by man made constructions and constraints. The work not only questions the reciprocal influence that exist between female bodies and nature, but also between the female body and society, ie how bodies are shaped by societal views and how we transform them in return.
