<div id="column-b"><p>Hosted by literary scholar Kaiama L. Glover and historian Laurent Dubois, the ‚ÄúIn All My Dreams‚Äù book club is an informal gathering of readers interested in discovering or exploring Haitian culture through the prism of Depestre‚Äôs Hadriana in All My Dreams. 
During each hour-long meeting, participants have come together to travel through the novel in the engaging company of a host of experts in the fields of Haitian literature, history, and anthropology. Brief reading guides indicate the narrative ground covered during each session and offer links to additional resources (for those who enjoy heading down the odd rabbit hole). Participants make use of the comments section on each page to share thoughts or to pose questions during the weeks leading up to or following the ‚Äòlive‚Äô meetings. These spaces were designed to serve as sites for ongoing query and conversation.
  The four sessions of this <a href="https://iamdbookclub.com" target="_blank">book club</a> culminate in an event with Edwidge Danticat at the French Embassy of New York on 19 February, 2020.
